# AGENTS.md - Operating Guide for Codex in this Java Web Project

Goal: Help with learning by doing, ensuring runnable code, passing tests, solid notes, and safe, reviewable changes. If the actual setup diverges from Section 0 (or any section), update this file immediately so it remains the single source of truth. All content in this file is in English. Default response language: Vietnamese (code stays in the original language when needed).

---

## 0) Context & Minimum Assumptions (Repo-Adjusted)

- Runtime: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5.6
- Build tool: Maven (wrapper located at `BE/EVRental/`)
  - Use `cd BE/EVRental && ./mvnw ...` (Linux/Mac) or `mvnw.cmd` (Windows)
- Database (dev): Microsoft SQL Server (JDBC) per `application.properties`; Hibernate `ddl-auto=update` (no Flyway yet)
- Tests: JUnit 5 via `spring-boot-starter-test`; H2 in test scope; MockMvc recommended (not widely used yet)
- Security: Spring Security + JWT (io.jsonwebtoken 0.12.5)
- Frontend (optional): Next.js app at `FE/Evrenter/`
  - Run with `npm run dev` (or `pnpm dev`) inside that folder
- API base path: server context-path `/EVRental`

If the project already uses a different stack or changes occur (DB switch, add Flyway/Testcontainers, move wrappers), preserve the current stack and update this section accordingly.

## 1) Personas

### Tutor (Learning coach)
- After any change > 30 lines or that touches new modules, update `LEARNING_NOTES.md`:
  - Explain why (trade-offs), add short doc links, and next-step TODOs
  - Provide clear documentation: setup steps, inline comments, API usage, rationale for architectural/security decisions
- Use simple language with examples and checklists

---

## 2) Project Conventions

- Packages & naming: standard Java; layer by package: `controller`, `service`, `repository`, `entity` (or `domain/model`), `config`, `dto`, `mapper`, `exception`
- Errors/Exceptions: use `@ControllerAdvice` to map errors to consistent JSON (`code`, `message`, `details`)
  - Current: `GlobalExceptionHandler` returns `Map<String,String>` for validation and `ApiResponse` for runtime
  - Target: unify into a single response schema
- DTO vs Entity: never expose entities directly; use DTO + Mapper (MapStruct available)
- Logging: `@Slf4j` or standard logger; `INFO` for main flow, `DEBUG` for details; never log sensitive data
- Format & Lint: none configured; keep style consistent (consider Spotless later)
- API: RESTful

---

## 3) Task Protocol (Tailored)

0. Approval gate: Present a brief explanation + plan; wait for OK. Do not modify code unless explicitly requested/approved.
1. Understand -> plan (files to touch, risks, intended tests)
2. Small steps (<= 200–300 LOC per change)
3. Minimum checks before proposing a patch:
   - Backend (from `BE/EVRental/`):
     - Run app: `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (or `mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run` on Windows)
     - Tests: `./mvnw -q -DskipTests=false test`
   - Frontend (from `FE/Evrenter/`):
     - Dev server: `npm run dev` (or `pnpm dev`)
4. Self-review: formatting consistent, tests green, API contract stable
5. Docs: update `README.md` and `LEARNING_NOTES.md`

Notes
- DB config lives at `BE/EVRental/src/main/resources/application.properties` and targets local SQL Server. Prefer ENV vars for secrets.
- The app serves under `/EVRental` context-path; reflect this in FE API calls and tests.
 

---

## 4) Tutor Guidance (Learning Mode)

- Response style (default): Long, student-friendly, easy to understand; explain concepts simply with concrete examples. Only shorten when the user asks for “short version”.
- Suggested structure for all guides:
  1) Overview (goal, context)
  2) Core concepts (plain-language explanation of terms/techniques)
  3) Preparation (env requirements, accounts, ENV variables)
  4) Steps (clear step-by-step: commands, file paths, APIs/endpoints)
  5) Testing (how to test, sample data, expected results)
  6) Troubleshooting (common errors and diagnostics)
  7) Customization/Advanced (templates, i18n, security, performance)
  8) Next steps (small, actionable)
- Presentation principles: avoid heavy jargon; if needed, define briefly. Prefer examples and checklists.
- Before code changes: follow the Approval gate in Section 3 (explain + plan, wait for OK).
- For sizable changes: summarize key concepts (Spring lifecycle, transactions, JPA cascades, Security filters, JWT), add 1–2 doc links, and suggest follow-ups (pagination, stronger tests, env-based config, Flyway migrations).

---

## 5) Git Rules

- Commit messages: clear (EN or VI); short summary + body if needed
- Do not mix large refactors with fixes/features in the same PR

---

## 6) Agent Notes

- Explain briefly before any large change
- When creating new files, add a header comment (purpose, quick test instructions)
- Keep `LEARNING_NOTES.md` evolving to support learn-by-doing
- If asked to perform an impossible task, do not produce a half-baked solution. Be honest, leave code unchanged, and ask for clarification.

## 14) “Aha” Moments → Write Back to AGENTS.md

### Aha Log

Guideline: Only add an Aha entry when it captures a significant insight, durable rule, or important decision. Skip trivial or routine changes.

#### [2025-10-16 04:30] Aha: English-only AGENTS.md and English default style
- Context: User requested the entire AGENTS.md be in English and default responses be long and student-friendly.
- Misunderstanding we had: Previous content mixed languages and defaulted to concise replies.
- What clicked: Set English-only documentation and adopt a long, structured guidance style by default.
- Decision/Rule: Keep AGENTS.md fully in English; default to long, student-friendly responses unless the user requests a short version.
- Example: Use the 8-part structure (Overview → Next steps) for guides.
- Impact: Updated Section 0, 3, and 4 to reflect English-only and guidance style.
- Follow-ups: Continue using this style for future tasks unless instructed otherwise.

#### [2025-10-16 04:20] Aha: Do not code without explicit request/OK
- Context: The user asked for a plan-and-approval step before any code change.
- Misunderstanding we had: Began editing code before explicit approval.
- What clicked: An approval gate is required before any code modification.
- Decision/Rule: Always present a brief explanation + plan; wait for OK; do not change code without explicit request/approval.
- Example: Flow = “Explain + Plan → User OK → Apply patch”.
- Impact: Updated Section 3 (added step 0: Approval gate); removed duplication elsewhere.
- Follow-ups: Apply this rule to every subsequent task.

#### [2025-10-16 04:05] Aha: Maven wrapper at BE/EVRental; DB is SQL Server
- Context: Align AGENTS.md with the current infrastructure.
- Misunderstanding we had: Assumed wrapper at repo root and PostgreSQL by default.
- What clicked: Maven wrapper is under `BE/EVRental/`; `application.properties` configures SQL Server; context-path is `/EVRental`.
- Decision/Rule: Run Maven from `BE/EVRental/`; honor SQL Server configuration; do not assume PostgreSQL; move secrets to ENV when refactoring.
- Example:
  - Run: `cd BE/EVRental && ./mvnw spring-boot:run`
  - JDBC: `spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433;databaseName=EVRental;trustServerCertificate=true`
- Impact: Updated Section 0 and Section 3; FE calls API under `/EVRental`.
- Follow-ups: Add Flyway (SQL Server); move secrets (JWT/DB) to ENV; add MockMvc tests; unify error schema `code/message/details`.

> Entries go on top (newest first). Use this template:

#### [YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm] Aha: <short title>
- Context: (1–3 lines: what we were doing/trying to fix)
- Misunderstanding we had: (what was wrong or ambiguous)
- What clicked: (the key realization; 1–2 lines)
- Decision/Rule: (the rule we will follow next time; imperative voice)
- Example: (tiny code/API/sample command showing the right pattern)
- Impact: (files/modules affected; any breaking considerations)
- Follow-ups: (tests/docs/tickets to add)

Operational rules
- If the “aha” implies a permanent rule, update the relevant section of this file (not only the log).
- Prefer actionable examples over theory.
- Do not loop the phrase inside the reflection body.
- If the correction changes canonical rules, update the relevant sections too.
